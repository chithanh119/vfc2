The documentary argues that his calculations failed because they overlooked one defining “X factor”: the unbreakable spirit and enduring determination of the Vietnamese people. This theme forms the philosophical backbone of the series—showing that the war was not merely a contest of force, but a confrontation between measurable metrics and the immeasurable strength of human will. The second episode follows Craig McNamara's deeply personal transformation—from a son witnessing his father's deceptions to a committed anti-war activist, a journey he recounts in his memoir Because Our Fathers Lied.Traveling to Vietnam, he retraces the war’s legacy, visiting battlefields and speaking with witnesses in his search for truth. The emotional peak of the film is Craig’s act of atonement at Trường Sơn National Martyrs’ Cemetery, where he offers a heartfelt apology on behalf of his father—an apology Robert McNamara never made.Told from a uniquely American viewpoint, the documentary honors the courage and resilience of the Vietnamese people while delivering a powerful narrative of healing and reconciliation between Vietnam and the United States.", episode: 1, duration: 60,  img: "images/documentary/battleofwill.png" },
